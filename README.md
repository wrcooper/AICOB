# AICOB
### Artificially Intelligent Chess Oriented Bot

A chess AI project made in my free time in order to experiment with different game AI algorithms!
Made in Python using pygame.

## Features
* AI moves generated by minimax decision algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning
* Adjustable algorithm search tree depth
* Toggle between player-controlled and AI controlled moves
* Generated PGN for each game, output to "pgn.txt"
* Saves previously calculated moves in a move dictionary represented in a json file


## Getting Started!
### Requirements
* Python 3+

##### 3. Run the program!
	$ py aicob.py
	
## Future Plans
* Add additional AI algorithms that the user can choose from
* Optimize/clean up code
* Implement Universal Chess Interface Support
* Add a move timer
* Enhance endgame moves
* Have AI break out of moves that lead to a repitition
* Improve AI performance

### Farther Future Plans
* Implement a chess chatbot to provide companionship, competition, and guidance to the player
