Artificially Intelligent Chess Oriented Bot

![screenshot.png](data/screenshot.png)

A chess AI project made in my free time in order to experiment with different game AI algorithms!

### Features
* AI moves generated by minimax decision algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning
* Adjustable algorithm search tree depth
* Toggle between player-controlled and AI controlled moves
* Generated PGN for each game

### Future Plans
* Add additional AI algorithms that the user can choose from
* Optimize code
* Implement Universal Chess Interface Support
* Add a move timer
* Save previously calculated best moves in a chess position dictionary
